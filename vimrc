" #3 Whitespace preferences and filetype

" autocmd FileType make setlocal ts=8 sts=8 sw=8 noexpandtab
" The first part of this command means to execute automatically the end of the command if the filetype of the file is make. Setlocal is like the set command but affects only the current buffer.i
" You need vim to be compiled with the autocmd option on. To check that run :version and check there is a '+' sign in front of autocmd.
" You can inquire about the filetype of a buffer with :set filetype?, and you can set it with set filetype myFileType.

" #4 Tidying whitespaces

" To convert spaces in tab and conversely use :retab!
" To remove trailing spaces usr :%s/\s\+$//e. \s stands for space, \+ means it should occur once or several times, the e at the end tells vim to ignore errors.
